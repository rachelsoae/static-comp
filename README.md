# Static Comp

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
Given a design composite, created a static replica of design utilizing only HTML and CSS. Added hover states and designed the HTML in a way that it could be made into a dynamic web application at a later date.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone it down to your machine
3. `cd` into the directory
4. Run `open index.html` to launch the application in your default browser

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
For this project I utilized only CSS, HTML, Visual Studio Code, Terminal, and Chrome DevTools. It took about 12 total hours to get to the point pictured above, though much of that time was spent learning how to use Google Materials Icons - very fun ðŸ˜Š

### Next Steps:
There is still a lot of work to do! While I am proud of the bones of the product I was able to create, I recognize there are a number of flaws with spacing; not to mention the bottom righthand section is completely unfinished. In the coming weeks I would like to finish this off with: 
- Completion of unfinished social media/tools section
- Fine tuning sizing and spacing in left-side  menu
- Adding colors to checkboxes in left-side menu
- Insertion of dynamic graphs, with hover states, able to reflect real data
